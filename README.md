# push_swap
The goal of this 42 school project is to create a sorting algorithm that uses 2 stacks and 11 different move. This project helps us learn the basics of algorithms and an introduction to the concept of complexity. There is a maximum number of moves that could be done before failling the project.
## Operations
The operations that we had acces to are the following:
  - pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of **b** and put it at the top of **a**
  - pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of **a** and put it at the top of **b**
  - sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack **a**
  - sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack **b**
  - ss: **sa** and **sb** at the same time
  - ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack **a** by 1
  - rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack **b** by 1
  - rr: **ra** and **rb** at the same time
  - rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack **a** by 1
  - rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack **b** by 1
  - rrr: **rra** and **rrb** at the same time
